### :notebook: Project Description:
The repository demonstrate the capabilities of data driven techniques by investigating the novel application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to maximising the profit of a battery from wholesale energy arbitrage. Largely based on the codeless academic paper from [Cao et al. (2019)](https://eprints.keele.ac.uk/8408/1/final_submitted_energy_storage_arbitrage_using_DRL%20(7).pdf), the post looks to apply the deep Q-network (DQN) model introduced by DeepMind in 2015, as well as investigate some the improvements made to the basic architecture. The above figure shows the results from a 10MW/20MWh Li-ion battery optimised using a "Double Dueling" DQN method.
